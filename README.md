#  Show, Ask, Attend, and Answer

My TensorFlow implementation of [*Show, Ask, Attend, and Answer: A Strong Baseline For Visual Question Answering* - Vahid Kazemi and Ali Elqursh](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03162). 

I wanted to try implementing a multimodal model in TF and this seemed like a good candidate. Lots of code needs to be added though
